# Define the steps

## Step I: Simplify the problem
In this section I will be looking for ways to simplify the problem Both from the data side and from the modelling side. 

### Data 
The fists step from the data side could be only working with the dataset of the customer with length 13. These cutomers constitute 84 and 87 percent of the data 


### Features


# todo
- preapare a submission with only the c13 customers
- normalize data by 98 percentile
- experiment with different sets of columns (for now just focus on the cont)
- experiment with pooling and attention 
- give numbers to the features for easier feature manipoulatioin

# Simplify
## Assumptions
- Nan values are replaced with 0
